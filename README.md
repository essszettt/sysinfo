Application to read system information on a ZX Soectrum Next. All information can be saved as text file.

The application is implemented as a DOT-command and can be called directly from BASIC.

Development is done using z88dk on Windows. The makefile should also work on Linux and macOS... I hope. ðŸ˜…

## REMARKS

Compiling the app takes very long time because of nested "switch-case" and many small strings, that needs to be "pooled" ...
Setting "--max-allocs-per-node" to "4000" instead of "200000" improves that dramatically ;-) ...
